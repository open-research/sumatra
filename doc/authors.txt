Licence
=======

Sumatra is freely available under the CeCILL v2 license, which is equivalent to,
and compatible with, the GNU GPL license, but conforms to French law (and is
also perfectly suited to international projects) - see
`<http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html>`_ for more information.

If you are interested in using Sumatra, but the choice of licence is a problem
for you, please contact us - we are open to persuasion.
