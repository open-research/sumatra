Reproducibility, provenance and project management
--------------------------------------------------

Reproducibility of experiments is one of the foundation stones of science.
A related concept is provenance, being able to track a given scientific result,
such as a figure in an article, back through all the analysis steps (verifying
the correctness of each) to the original raw data, and the experimental protocol
used to obtain it.

In computational, simulation-based science, reproduction of previous
experiments, and establishing the provenance of results, ought to be easy, given
that computers are deterministic, not suffering from the problems of
inter-subject and trial-to-trial variability that make reproduction of
biological experiments more challenging.

In general, however, it is not easy, perhaps due to the complexity of our code
and our computing environments, and the difficulty of capturing every essential
piece of information needed to reproduce a computational experiment using
existing tools such as spreadsheets, version control systems and paper
noteboooks.

What needs to be recorded?
--------------------------

To ensure reproducibility of a computational experiment we need to record:
    
* the code that was run
* any parameter files and command line options
* the platform on which the code was run

For an individual researcher trying to keep track of a research project with
many hundreds or thousands of simulations, it is also useful to record the
following:

* the reason for which the simulation was run
* a summary of the outcome of the simulation

Recording the code might mean storing a copy of the executable, or the source
code (including that of any libraries used), the compiler used (including version)
and the compilation procedure (e.g. the Makefile, etc.)
For interpreted code, it might mean recording the version of the interpreter
(and any options used in compiling it) as well as storing a copy of the
simulation script, and of any external modules or packages that are included or
imported into the script file.

For projects using version control, "storing a copy of the code" may be replaced
with "recording the URL of the repository and the revision number".

The platform includes the processor architecture(s), the operating system(s),
the number of processors (for distributed simulations), etc.

Tools for recording provenance information
------------------------------------------

The traditional way of recording the information necessary to reproduce an
experiment is by noting down all details in a paper notebook, together with
copies or print-outs of any results. More modern approaches may replace or
augment the paper notebook with a spreadsheet or other hand-rolled database, but
still with the feature that all relevant information is entered by hand.

In other areas of science, particularly in applied science laboratories with
high-throughput, highly-standardised procedures, electronic lab notebooks and
laboratory information management systems (LIMS) are in widespread use, but none
of these tools seem to be well suited for tracking simulation experiments.

Challenges for tracking computational experiments
---------------------------------------------------------------

In developing a tool for tracking simulation experiments, something like an
electronic lab notebook for computational science, there are a number of
challenges:

* different researchers have very different ways of working and different
  workflows: command line, GUI, batch-jobs (e.g. in supercomputer
  environments), or any combination of these for different components (simulation,
  analysis, graphing, etc.) and phases of a project.

* some projects are essentially solo endeavours, others collaborative projects,
  possibly distributed geographically.

* as much as possible should be recorded automatically. If it is left to the
  researcher to record critical details there is a risk that some details will
  be missed or left out, particularly under pressure of deadlines.

The solution we propose is to develop a core library, implemented as a Python
package, ``sumatra``, and then to develop a series of interfaces that build on
top of this: a command-line interface, a web interface, a graphical interface.
Each of these interfaces will enable:

* launching simulations with automated recording of provenance information;
* managing a simulaion project: browsing, viewing, deleting simulations.

Alternatively, modellers can use the ``sumatra`` package directly in their own
code, to enable provenance recording, then simply launch simulations in their
usual way.

The core ``sumatra`` package needs to:

* interact with version control systems, such as Subversion_, Git_, Mercurial_, or
  Bazaar_;
* support launching serial, distributed (via MPI_) or batch simulations;
* link to data generated by the simulation, whether stored in files or databases;
* support all and any simulation programs;
* support both local and networked storage of simulation information;
* be extensible, so that components can easily be added for new version control
  systems, etc.
* be very easy to use, otherwise it will only be used by the very conscientious.
